## Overview

Based on the EventEmitter2 library.
Notable differences with EventEmitter2 library:

  - Constructor will bind prototype properties to any context
  - Methods are chainable.
  - Wildcard matching enabled by default.
  - Added "domain" usage.
  - _conf property renamed to _channel
  - default "error" callback can be set to avoid throwing "unspecified 'error' event" error
  - custom logger can be set, defaults to "console"
